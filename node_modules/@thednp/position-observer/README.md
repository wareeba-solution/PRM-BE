If you were looking for an observer that could replace all your `resize` and/or `scroll` EventListeners, this should be it! The **PositionObserver** works with the [IntersectionObserver API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver) under the hood and uses a very simple design.

The **PositionObserver** provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the position of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport. It tries to do what you would expect after your element has intersected as if you would listen to `resize` or `scroll` without attaching event listeners.


## Installation

```bash
npm i @thednp/position-observer
```

```bash
yarn add @thednp/position-observer
```

```bash
pnpm add @thednp/position-observer
```

```bash
deno add npm:@thednp/position-observer@latest
```


## Usage

```ts
// import the PositionObserver class
import PositionObserver, { type PositionObserverEntry } from '@thednp/position-observer';

// find a suitable target
const myTarget = document.getElementById('myElement');

// define a callback
const callback = (entries: PositionObserverEntry[], currentObserver: PositionObserver) => {
  /* keep an eye on your entries */
  // console.log(entries);

  // access the observer inside your callback
  // to find entry for myTarget
  const entry = currentObserver.getEntry(myTarget);
  if (entry.target === myTarget/* and/or other conditions */) {
    // do something about it
  }
};

// set some options
const options = {
  // if not set, it will use the document.documentElement
  root: document.getElementById('myModal'),
}

// create the observer
const observer = new PositionObserver(callback, options);

// start observing the target element position
observer.observe(target);

// when the position of the element changes from DOM manipulations and/or
// the position change was triggered by either scroll / resize events
// these will be the entries of this observer callback example
[{
  // the observed target element
  target: <div#myElement>,
  // the target's bounding client react
  boundingClientRect: DOMRect,
  // parent <div#myModal> root clientWidth
  clientWidth: number,
  // root <div#myModal> clientHeight
  clientHeight: number,
}]

// anytime you need the entry, find it!!
observer.getEntry(target);

// stop observing the changes for #myElement at any point
observer.unobserve(target);

// when no targets require observation
// you should disconect the observer
observer.disconect();
```


## Instance Options

### root: Element | undefined
Sets the `instance._root` private property which identifies the `Element` whose bounds are treated as the bounding box of the viewport for the element which is the observer's target. If not defined then the `Document.documentElement` will be used.

When observing multiple targets from a **scrollable** parent element, that parent must be set as root. The same applies to embeddings and `IFrame`s. See the [ScrollSpy](https://github.com/thednp/bootstrap.native/blob/master/src/components/scrollspy.ts) example for implementation details.


## How it works
* when the observer is initialized without a callback, it will throw an `Error`;
* if you call the `observe()` method without a valid Element target, it will throw an `Error`;
* if the target isn't attached to the DOM, it will not be added to the observer entries;
* once propertly set up, the **PositionObserver** will observe the changes of either **top** or **left** for a given Element target in relation to its designated root, as well as the **clientWidth** and **clientHeight** of that parent;
* when the target Element is intersecting with the bounds of the designated viewport and at least one of the observed values changes, only then the target's entry will be queued for the callback runtime.


## Notes
* **use with caution**: for performance reasons, if your callback is focused on values of the target's bounding client rect, be sure to make use of `entry.boundingClientRect` values (`observer.getEntry(target)`) instead of invoking `getBoundingClientRect()` again on your target;
* this implementation is partially inspired by the [async-bounds](https://github.com/glued/async-bounds), the async model is very efficient;
* if nothing happens when observing a target, please know that the observer's runtime will only call the callback for elements that are descendents of the given root element; this also means that if a target is removed from the document, the target's entry will not be queued into the runtime;
* also if the target element is hidden with either `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` or attributes with the same effect, the bounding box always has ZERO values and never changes, so make sure to have your target visible before calling `observer.observe(target)`;
* because the functionality is powered by `requestAnimationFrame` and **IntersectionObserver**, all computation is always processed asynchronously before the next paint, in some cases you might want to consider wrapping your **PositionObserver** callback in a `requestAnimationFrame()` invokation for a consistent syncronicity and to eliminate any [unwanted anomalies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver#observation_errors);
* while the performance benefits over the use of event listeners is undeniable, it's still **important** to `unobserve` targets or `disconnect` the observer to make room in the main thread;
* how about an idea to make your **PositionObserver** instance work like a `ResizeObserver`, well you can simply filter your callback with the inequality of `entry.boundingClientRect.height` and `lastHeight` OR `entry.boundingClientRect.width` and `lastWidth` cases, easy right?
* lastly, the **PositionObserver** will observe changes to all sides of a target, but in some cases you might want to narrow down to the changes triggered by scroll, mainly top and left, in which case you can filter your callback to a single side `entry.boundingClientRect.top !== lastTop`, further increasing performance.
